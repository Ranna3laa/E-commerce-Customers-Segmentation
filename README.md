# 🚀 E-commerce Customers Segmentation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting e-commerce customers based on their shopping behavior. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to categorize customers into distinct groups, enabling businesses to tailor their marketing strategies more effectively. 🎯

## 📊 Dataset
- The dataset contains customer details collected from an e-commerce platform.
- Includes demographic information, purchase history, and transaction details.
- Loaded from an Excel file and preprocessed to remove redundancies before analysis. 📂

## 🏗 Project Structure
### 🔍 Data Analysis (`E-commerce Customers Segmentation Analysis.ipynb`)
- Load and explore the dataset. 📥
- Merge multiple sheets from the Excel file. 🔗
- Perform data cleaning and feature selection. 🧹
- Visualize customer spending patterns using Python libraries (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`). 📊

### 🤖 Model Building (`E-commerce Customers Segmentation Model.ipynb`)
- Apply clustering algorithms (`K-Means`, `Hierarchical Clustering`). 🔬
- Determine the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score. 🎯
- Train the model and analyze the segmentation results. 🏆
- Visualize clusters using dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE). 🌍

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 📓 **Jupyter Notebook**
- 🏗 **Pandas, NumPy**
- 📊 **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly**
- 🤖 **Scikit-learn (for clustering algorithms)**

## 🎯 Results
- Provides customer segmentation insights. 🔍
- Helps businesses identify different customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
- Can be used for personalized marketing and strategic decision-making. 💡
